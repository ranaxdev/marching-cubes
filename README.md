# TO-DO

## Implementation

- Debug cube with clickable vertices (construct triangles from there)
- Buffer size passing to rendering functions
- Live isovalue edit (reconstruct triangle buffers live)
- Matching debug vertices (black/white) with isovalue
- Vertex normal calculation
- Different buffer sizes enum ONE_MB, FIVE_MB through param etc..
