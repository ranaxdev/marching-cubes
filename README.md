# TO-DO

## Implementation

- Major cleanup, standardize loading in models
- grid size stuff
- 2 debug cells side by side to show no ambiguities

## Writing
- Write about optimization (grid only bands near isosurface)
- All the cases generated w/ pics
- Wrong case in MC tables w/ fixed papers (reflection in impl)
- in implementation show implicit then with data
- nrrd format, write about raw data used
- debugging stuff

- Wyvill blobby surfaces 1986
- Summary at end of each chapter
- For validation write not only results but discussion (important)
- For validation: triangle output match, performance with other MC impl,
- See performance with other objs too not just fuel injector
  gradient vs face comparison (qualitative evaluation)
  - Design section?
