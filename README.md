# TO-DO

## Implementation

- Debug cube with clickable vertices (construct triangles from there)
- Buffer size passing to rendering functions
- Live isovalue edit (reconstruct triangle buffers live)
- Matching debug vertices (black/white) with isovalue
- Vertex normal calculation
- Different buffer sizes enum ONE_MB, FIVE_MB through param etc..

## Writing
- Write about optimization (grid only bands near isosurface)
- All the cases generated w/ pics
- Wrong case in MC tables w/ fixed papers (reflection in impl)
- in implementation show implicit then with data
- nrrd format, write about raw data used
- debugging stuff
